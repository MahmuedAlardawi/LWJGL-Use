# LWJGL-Use
King AbdulAziz Universality - Computer Graphics (CPCS-391)

## Overview

This project involves the creation of a computer graphics application using LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library). It focuses on rendering and transforming 2D shapes, enhancing them with 3D transformations or textures, and incorporating user interaction through keyboard inputs.

## Features

- **2D Shape Creation:** Generate a 2D shape using GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP.
- **Rotation and Color Changes:** Rotate the shape by 200 degrees on the Z axis and apply a color change.
- **Continuous Animation:** Implement a continuous rotation animation on the Y axis.
- **3D Transformation or Texturing:** Enhance the shape by converting it to 3D or applying a texture.
- **Interactive Translations and Scaling:** Use keyboard inputs (W, A, S, D, U, J, K, H, M, N) to translate and scale the shape across different axes.

## Installation Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Java JDK:** Recommended JDK 11 or above.
- **LWJGL:** This project requires the installation of Lightweight Java Game Library. Detailed installation instructions can be found on the [LWJGL official website](https://www.lwjgl.org/).
